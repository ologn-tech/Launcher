- Set a password to exit kiosk mode or access device settings
- Schedule kiosk mode to start and stop at specific times
- Restart the device automatically at a specific time

- Support for Android 4.4 and above

## Usage
To exit kiosk mode, follow these steps:

1. Tap on the exit button on the top right corner of the home screen.
2. Enter your password and tap on OK.
3. Tap on the stop button to deactivate kiosk mode.
